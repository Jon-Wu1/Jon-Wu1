Hi, my name is Jonathan Wu.
I am a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer with experience in building scalable web applications. Having done both frontend and backend development, I specialize in using React, Node.js, and TypeScript to build dynamic, user-focused applications. My work with Kubernetes and Docker has given me insight into DevOps and allowed me to focus on UI/UX design. I'm currently developing a Kubernetes dashboard that utilizes advanced tools such as Prometheus and Grafana as well as React component libraries such as Material-UI to improve cluster observability. I'm very interested in building modern development tools to solve common pain points in popular technologies such as Kubernetes. Feel free to connect with me to discuss innovative tech solutions, share insights, or explore collaboration opportunities!
